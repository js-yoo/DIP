## This report was prepared after proceeding with the Term project for Image Super-resolution. Image super-resolution means converting a low-resolution image into a 
high-resolution image. The reason why Image Super-resolution is needed is as follows. In the past, most SD-level images of 640x480 size were used. However, in recent years, 
due to the advancement of hardware, full HD-level displays have become possible and have become more popular, so there is an important problem that the size of past images 
must be converted. Therefore, in this report, three classical techniques, Nearest Neighbor, Bilinear interpolation, and Bicubic interpolation, are first described 
in the main body. And a technique called SRMDNF will be described. Then, in the result part, the implementation code of the four techniques, the result image, and the evaluation 
index PSNR value are shown. The final conclusion compares the four techniques, discusses discussion, and future plans.
